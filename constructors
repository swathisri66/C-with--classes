CONSTRUCTORS and DESTRUCTORS
Constructor : It is a function used to create an object & initialize the data members of the class
			  If the variables are not initialized, then they will contain grabage values
			  
			  Constructor has the following special features
			  1)	It contains the same name as the name of the class
			  2)	It has no return datatype, not even void
			  3)	It must be a public function only, cannot be private or protected
			  4)	such function is called as constructor and will be executed automatically
			  		when the object of that class is created.
			  		
			Constructors are of different types
			-> System defined constructor : this constructor is created by the compiler when
											user did not provide any constructor in the class.
			-> User defined constructor	  : we create the constructor as per our requirement
					- Default constructor
					- Parameterized constructor
					- Copy constructor
					- Null constructor
					- Dynamic constructor

Destructor		: It is function used to remove the data members from the object and also
					remove the object.
				  If the object is not destroyed then the class will be closed but the 
				  	variables created by the class will keep occupying the memory.
				  This causes 2 problems	Memory wastage	&  Memory leakage
			
				  Destructor has the following special features
			  1)	It has the same name as the name of the class prefixed with ~ (tilde symbol)
			  2)	It has no return datatype, not even void
			  3)	It must be a public function only, cannot be private or protected
			  4)	such function is called as destructor and will be executed automatically
			  		when the main() is about to close. [after the last statement of the program]
			  		Destructor works for every object once.

			Destructors are of two type
			-> System defined destructor : this destructor is created by the compiler when
											user did not provide any destructor in the class.
			-> User defined destructor	  : we have only one type of destructor
					- Default destructor
