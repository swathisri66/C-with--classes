ccin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

In the following example, the user can input a number, which is stored in the variable x. 
Then we print the value of x:

Ex:

int x;
cout << "Type a number: ";  // type a number and enter
cin >> x; // user input from keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; // display input value


cout is pronounced "see-out". Used for output, and uses the insertion operator (<<)

cin is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (>>)

// input two numbers, and then we print the sum://

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
int x, y;
int sum;
cout << "Type a number: ";
cin >> x;
cout << "Type another number: ";
cin >> y;
sum = x + y;
cout << "Sum is: " << sum;
return 0;
}
