/* Hierarchical Inheritance : Deriving many sub classes from one base class
     In this type of inheritance, as there are many derived classes, we need to 
     create object of each of the derived classes to access that class & base class member 
  Hierarchical Inheritance is many single inheritances where base class is common  */
