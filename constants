Constants
When you do not want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword 
(this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

const int myNum = 15; // no change
myNum = 10; //error 

ex:

const int minutesperhour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;
